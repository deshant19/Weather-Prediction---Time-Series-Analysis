# Weather-Prediction -Time-Series-Analysis

## Introduction 

Climate change can affect the intensity and frequency of precipitation. Warmer oceans increase the amount of water that evaporates into the air. This in turn can produce more intense precipitation. The potential impacts of heavy precipitation include crop damage, soil erosion, and an increase in flood risk due to heavy rains, which in turn can lead to injuries, drownings, and other flooding-related effects on health. The prediction helps people to take preventive measures and can help reduce possible financial loss. Accuracy of rainfall statements also has importance for countries  whose economy relies heavily on agriculture. 

## Objective
Our aim is to conduct a series of studies by using machine learning techniques to create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on the weather data for that day in major cities in Australia.

## Dataset
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.
Attribute Information:

- Variable	    Description
- Date	        The date of observation
- Location	    The common name of the location of the weather station
MinTemp	      The minimum temperature in degrees celsius
MaxTemp	      The maximum temperature in degrees celsius
Rainfall	    The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm
Evaporation	  The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am
Sunshine	    The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day
WindGustDir	  The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight
WindGustSpeed	The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight
WindDir9am	  Direction of the wind at 9am
WindDir3pm	  Direction of the wind at 3pm
WindSpeed9am	Speed of the wind at 9am
WindSpeed3pm	Speed of the wind at 3pm
Humidity9am	  Humidity at 9am
Humidity3pm	  Humidity at 3pm
Pressure9am	  Barometer Pressure at 9am
Pressure3pm	  Barometer Pressure at 3pm
Cloud9am	    Cloud cover at 9am
Cloud3pm	    Cloud cover at 3pm
Temp9am	      Temperature at 9am
Temp3pm	      Temperature at 3pm
RainToday	    Whether it rained today or not
RainTomorrow	RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No?  This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or  more.
